All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format loosely
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [0.18.1] — 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **Quit confirmation dialog was non-functional.** `Action::QuitConfirm`
  set `running = false` directly — identical to `Action::Quit` — with no
  dialog window ever created anywhere in the codebase. `quit_win` was
  declared, initialized, and read in two places (`restack()`,
  `on_destroy()`), but never once assigned `Some(_)`. Consolidated into a
  single `Action::Quit` bound to `Mod4+Shift+Q`; removed the dead
  scaffolding (`quit_win` field, the raise-above-fullscreen hook, the
  destroy-notify cleanup hook, an orphaned doc comment left dangling above
  an unrelated function).
  (`3465939`)

- **Bar workspace-tag clicks could desync from what was rendered.**
  `tag_at_x()` counted glyphs by filtering out every character above
  U+00FF; `draw()`'s `to_latin1()` counts every character and substitutes
  `?` for anything above U+00FF. Same tag name in, two different glyph
  counts out — the click hitbox drifted from the rendered label the
  moment a tag name held a non-Latin1 character. Invisible with the
  default numeric tag names, but breaks click-to-switch for anyone who
  customizes them with icons, CJK, or emoji. `tag_at_x()` now calls
  `to_latin1()` directly so the two can't diverge again.
  (`557ba37`)

- **New-column width was inconsistent depending on how the column was
  created.** `add_tiled` (opening a new window) sized every column past
  the first at 75% of the workarea. `apply_move_dir`'s extract-to-new-
  column branch and `new_column()` (`Mod4+Shift+Return`) instead used a
  fixed `default_col_w` (700px), which doesn't scale with monitor
  resolution and made the same logical action — "put this window in its
  own column" — look very different depending on which keybind triggered
  it. All three paths now compute the same 75%-of-workarea width.
  (`6f7a9d6`)

- **Browser file-picker / upload dialogs never appeared.** Root cause of
  a previously-diagnosed issue: neither `xdg-desktop-portal` nor
  `xdg-desktop-portal-gtk` was ever started. `detect_portal()` only
  floats the dialog window once one exists — it can't conjure one if the
  backing service never launched. Added both to `autostart`, with full
  paths (`/usr/lib/...`) since neither binary lives on `$PATH` on Arch.
  (`734e4ec`)

### Changed

- New-column sizing is now unified around workarea percentage, so
  `default_col_w` in `Cfg` no longer drives column width anywhere in the
  live code path. Left the field in place for now rather than remove
  config surface as a side effect of a bug-fix pass.

### Docs

- README / README.es.md: bar section now describes the raw-X11
  (`image_text8` / `poly_fill_rectangle`) rendering path instead of the
  retired `xft.rs` FFI wrapper; dropped an unverified `~3–4 MB` resident
  memory figure from that section rather than leave it stale; keybind
  table no longer claims a confirmation dialog on quit.
  (`4499fb0`)
- Restored English-only inline comments — six spots had reverted to, or
  were left in, Spanish (one mixed both languages in the same comment
  block); fixed a compositor config comment that still described an
  opacity flag removed a few commits earlier.
  (`d452b7b`)

### Known issues

Flagged during this pass, not fixed here — bigger changes, out of scope
for a bug-fix batch:

- `core/engine.rs`'s `process_event` / `AppEvent` / `Command` path is
  never invoked by the running window manager — `backend/x11.rs`
  reimplements `ToggleBar`, `CycleLayout`, `SetLayout`, and window
  creation directly instead of going through it. 3 of the 7 unit tests
  (`test_toggle_bar_hides_and_shows`, `test_cycle_layout_wraps_around`,
  `test_window_created_emits_layout_commands`) exercise only that
  disconnected path and don't protect the code that actually ships.
- `Workspace::move_window_right()` (`types.rs`) has no caller anywhere in
  the tree — dead code, found while fixing the column-width
  inconsistency above.
